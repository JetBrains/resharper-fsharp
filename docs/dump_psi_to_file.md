## Dumping the PSI to a file

For some purposes it's helpful to dump the [PSI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html) to a file and have a look at it.  
There's existing functionality in the `ReSharper.FSharp.sln` solution to help with that.
- Open the file `ReSharper.FSharp\test\data\parsing\_.fs` (switch on `Show All Files` in the Rider Explorer if it's not visible).
- Manipulate the content of the file to your liking.
- Navigate to `ReSharper.FSharp/test/src/FSharp.Tests/Parsing/FSharpParserTest.fs`.
- Execute the test `x.``_``()`.
- It will most likely fail with `â€œThere is no gold file at ...`. But a file with the textual representation of the PSI will appear in `ReSharper.FSharp/test/data/parsing/_.fs.tmp`.
