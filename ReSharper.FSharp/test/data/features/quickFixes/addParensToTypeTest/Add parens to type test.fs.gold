module Test

let o = obj()
let _ = |not |o|(1) :? string|(0)

------------------------------------------------
0: The type 'bool' does not have any proper subtypes and cannot be used as the source of a type test or runtime coercion.
QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to type test
1: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'obj'    
NO QUICKFIXES
