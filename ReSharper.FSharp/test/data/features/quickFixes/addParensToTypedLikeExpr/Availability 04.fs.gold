let _ = |not |a|(1) :?> B|(0)

------------------------------------------------
0: The type 'bool' does not have any proper subtypes and cannot be used as the source of a type test or runtime coercion.
QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type cast
1: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'A'    
QUICKFIXES:
Change type of 'a' to 'bool'
