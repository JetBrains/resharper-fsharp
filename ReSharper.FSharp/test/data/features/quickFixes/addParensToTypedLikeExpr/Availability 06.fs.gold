module Test

type A() = class end
type [<Sealed>] B() = inherit A()

let b = B()

let _ = |not |b|(0)|(1) :> A

------------------------------------------------
0: Type constraint mismatch. The type 
    'bool'    
is not compatible with type
    'A'    

QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type cast
1: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'B'    
QUICKFIXES:
Change type of 'b' to 'bool'
