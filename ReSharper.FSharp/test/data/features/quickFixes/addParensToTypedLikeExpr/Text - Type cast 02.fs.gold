module Test

let o = obj()
let _ = ||not |o|(1)|(2) :> string|(0)

------------------------------------------------
0: The type 'string' does not have any proper subtypes and need not be used as the target of a static coercion
NO QUICKFIXES
1: Type constraint mismatch. The type 
    'bool'    
is not compatible with type
    'string'    

QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type cast
2: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'obj'    
QUICKFIXES:
Change type of 'o' to 'bool'
