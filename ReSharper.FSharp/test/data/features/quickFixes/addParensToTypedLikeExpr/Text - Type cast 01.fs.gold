module Test

let o = obj()
let _ = |not |o|(1) :?> string|(0)

------------------------------------------------
0: The type 'bool' does not have any proper subtypes and cannot be used as the source of a type test or runtime coercion.
QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type cast
1: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'obj'    
QUICKFIXES:
Change type of 'o' to 'bool'
