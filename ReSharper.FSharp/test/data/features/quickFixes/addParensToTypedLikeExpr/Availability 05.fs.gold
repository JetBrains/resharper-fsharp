module Test

type A() = class end
type [<Sealed>] B() = inherit A()

let b = B()

let _ = |not |b|(1) :? A|(0)

------------------------------------------------
0: The type 'bool' does not have any proper subtypes and cannot be used as the source of a type test or runtime coercion.
QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type test
1: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'B'    
QUICKFIXES:
Change type of 'b' to 'bool'
