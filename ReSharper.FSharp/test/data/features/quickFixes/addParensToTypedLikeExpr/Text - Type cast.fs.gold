------------------------------------------------
0: The type 'bool' does not have any proper subtypes and cannot be used as the source of a type test or runtime coercion.
QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type cast
1: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'obj'    
NO QUICKFIXES
2: The type 'string' does not have any proper subtypes and need not be used as the target of a static coercion
NO QUICKFIXES
3: Type constraint mismatch. The type 
    'bool'    
is not compatible with type
    'string'    

QUICKFIXES:
Add parens to the type cast
4: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'    
but here has type
    'obj'    
NO QUICKFIXES
