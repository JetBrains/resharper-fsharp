module Module

let a, b = |()|(0)
|and|(1) b x = ()

------------------------------------------------
0: This expression was expected to have type
    ''a * 'b'    
but here has type
    'unit'    
QUICKFIXES:
Change typeof binding to 'unit'
1: The declaration form 'let ... and ...' is only allowed for recursive bindings. Consider using a sequence of 'let' bindings
NO QUICKFIXES
