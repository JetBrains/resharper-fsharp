(0): ReSharper Warning: The result of this expression has type 'int' and is implicitly ignored. Consider using 'ignore' to discard this value explicitly, e.g. 'expr |> ignore', or 'let' to bind the result to a name, e.g. 'let result = expr'.
(1): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: This expression was expected to have type
    'int'    
but here has type
    'float'
