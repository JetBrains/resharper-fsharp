# List of revisions that are hidden from git blame annotations.
# This concerns massive code re-formatting, renaming, large changes
# that were later reverted, etc.
#
# Configure your git so that it always ignores the revisions listed
# in this file:
#
#     git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# When adding a new revision to the list, please put its commit message
# in a comment above it.
